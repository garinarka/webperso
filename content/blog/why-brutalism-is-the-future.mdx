# Why Brutalism Is The Future of Web Design

Everyone is building the same boring minimalist website.
White background. Clean sans-serif. Subtle hover effects.
You've seen one, you've seen them all.

## The Problem with Safe Design

The web has become homogenized. Bootstrap, Material UI,
and Tailwind's default styles have made everything look identical.

**This is boring.** And boring is the enemy of memorable.

## What is Brutalism?

Web brutalism takes cues from brutalist architecture:

- Raw materials exposed
- Function over decoration
- Intentional "roughness"
- Anti-polish aesthetic

## Why It Works

1. **Memorable** - You won't forget a brutalist site
2. **Fast** - Less decoration = better performance
3. **Honest** - No fake gradients or stock photos
4. **Different** - Stand out in a sea of sameness

## The Punk Connection

Brutalism shares DNA with punk music:

- Reject mainstream aesthetics
- Do it yourself
- Express yourself authentically
- Break the rules with purpose

> "Punk is musical freedom. It's saying, doing and playing
> what you want." - Kurt Cobain

## Conclusion

You don't have to build boring websites.
The web needs more personality, more character, more soul.

Be different. Be brutal. Be punk.
